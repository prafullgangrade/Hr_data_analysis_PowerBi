**Introduction**

A HR data analysis dashboard in Power BI is a visual tool that helps human resources professionals to track and analyze various metrics related to employee performance, recruitment, retention, and overall workforce management. 

The dashboard typically includes a set of interactive charts, graphs, and tables that provide insights into key HR metrics, such as headcount, turnover rate, recruitment funnel, employee engagement, and training effectiveness. The data is usually sourced from various HR systems, such as HRIS, ATS, LMS, and employee surveys.
